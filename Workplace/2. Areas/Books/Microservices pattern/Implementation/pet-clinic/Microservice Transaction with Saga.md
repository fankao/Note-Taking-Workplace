Certainly! Below is a list of **scenarios** in the PetClinic project where the **Saga Pattern** can be applied. These scenarios represent distributed transactions across multiple services where each service completes a part of the process, and compensating transactions may be required in case of failures.

---

### 1. **Scheduling a Pet Visit**

#### Scenario:
- The user schedules a new visit for their pet, which involves checking pet information, veterinarian availability, and scheduling the visit.

#### Saga Process:
1. The **Visit Service** initiates the saga by creating a visit.
2. The **Customer Management Service** validates the pet and owner details.
3. The **Veterinarian Service** confirms the veterinarian’s availability.
4. If any step fails (e.g., invalid pet information or unavailable veterinarian), compensating transactions are triggered to cancel the visit and revert any changes made.

### Conclusion:

These scenarios illustrate various distributed transactions in the PetClinic project where the **Saga Pattern** can be applied. The key point of the Saga Pattern is to ensure **eventual consistency** across multiple services and provide **compensating actions** when failures occur. Each of these scenarios involves multiple services completing part of the process and the ability to rollback changes if one step fails.
