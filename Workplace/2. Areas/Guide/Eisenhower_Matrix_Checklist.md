		- **Low Risk**: Minimal risks → **Score: 1-3**
- ## Summary
- **Importance** scores reflect how crucial a task is to your long-term goals, responsibilities, and the consequences of not completing it.
- **Urgency** scores reflect how soon a task needs to be completed, considering deadlines, time sensitivity, dependencies, and external pressures.
  
  By using this detailed checklist, you can assign more accurate importance and urgency scores to your tasks, leading to better prioritization within the Eisenhower Matrix.
