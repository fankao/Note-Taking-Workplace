**1 . Introduce myself**
Hello, my name is Nguyễn Minh Chiến. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am currently a Java Fullstack Developer at PAL Tech, with over 3 years of experience in developing backend systems for large-scale, high-traffic projects.

At PAL Tech, I develop and maintain a financial data integration and reporting system using Java and Spring Boot. My responsibilities include creating robust backend systems, integrating services with existing platforms, and developing RESTful APIs. I also work with Docker, Docker Compose, and GitLab CI for CI/CD processes.

Before joining PAL Tech, I worked as a Java Developer at FPT Software, where I handled projects related to wind turbine operations and data collection systems. I developed backend applications using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes, and I can effectively work with microservices architecture and Kubernetes.

I have extensive experience with Java Spring-Framework, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. I have a good understanding of distributed services and object-oriented programming, which enables me to design scalable and maintainable systems.

I am open-minded, honest, and have a positive attitude. I excel in collaboration and communication, including in English.

I am passionate about solving complex problems and am excited about opportunities that allow me to work on innovative and impactful projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills can contribute to your team.
